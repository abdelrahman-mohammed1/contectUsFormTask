# Contact Us Form Project

## Project Overview

This project is a React application that provides a contact form for users to submit inquiries or support requests. It leverages `Headless UI` components for form structure and `Formik` for form state management and validation. The form includes fields for first name, last name, email address, query type, and a message. Additionally, users are required to provide consent before submitting their information.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Form Interface:** Built with `Headless UI` for accessible and well-structured form components.
- **Validation with Formik & Yup:** Form state management and validation are handled by `Formik` and `Yup`. Users receive real-time feedback on input errors (e.g., missing fields, invalid email formats).
- **Custom Styling:** Styled with `Tailwind CSS` to provide a responsive and clean interface.
- **Error Handling:** Displays error messages for invalid or missing inputs.
- **Two Query Types:** Users can choose between "General Enquiry" and "Support Request."
- **Consent Checkbox:** Submission requires user consent for further contact.
